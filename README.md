## Our Mission

Umbra Linux is a distribution based on **Linux From Scratch 12.3 (systemd)**. It offers the educational and transparent foundation of LFS, combined with a **ready-to-use user experience** â€“ no manual [[compiling]] needed.

#### Three prebuilt desktop configurations:

1. **Umbra Linux Classic** â€“ A lightweight, clean experience inspired by macOS:  
    XFCE + Docky delivers elegance and simplicity. Great for newcomers and those who want a familiar layout.
    
2. **Umbra Linux Flux** â€“ For power users and tiling window manager fans:  
    Wayland + Sway gives you full control with a fast, minimalist interface and CLI-focused tools.
    
3. **Umbra Linux Studio** â€“ Based on **Umbra Classic**, tailored for musicians:  
    Comes with **REAPER** preinstalled, plus LV2/VST plugin support and JACK/PipeWire audio routing. Fully configured to work out of the box.
    

ðŸ”¹ **Powered by systemd** â€“ modern service management  
ðŸ”¹ **Includes developer and multimedia tools**  
ðŸ”¹ **Minimal by default** â€“ no extra software you donâ€™t need  
ðŸ”¹ **Great for learning** â€“ transparent LFS base for those curious about Linux internals.
